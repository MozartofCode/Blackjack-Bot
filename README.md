# Blackjack-Bot

A Decentralized casino experience with a bot powered with AI-based decision making
(Improvement on my previous personal project where I created a blackjack bot using java)


1- Gameplay (React JS frontend and Flask Python backend)

2- Smart Contracts (Solidity) for payment of money

3- Simulation of profits for the bot

4- Creation of multiple bots with pretrained model, my own AI program and the strategy from the movie '21'

5- Real Game play with a bot, house and a player
