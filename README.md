# Blackjack-Bot

A Decentralized casino experience with a bot powered with AI-based decision making
(Improvement on my previous personal project where I created a blackjack bot using java)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack

1- Gameplay (React JS frontend and Flask Python backend)

2- Smart Contracts (Solidity) for payment of money

3- Simulation of profits for the bot

4- Creation of multiple bots with pretrained model, my own AI program and the strategy from the movie '21'

5- Real Game play with a bot, house and a player

6- Idea: Retrain data or reinforcement learning? with the stats that I get from the bots



Rules of the Game for this simulation:

1- Played with 5 regular decks (52 cards each)
2- One house and 4 players (3 bot and 1 actual player, you)
3- Actions are hit, stay, double, split and surrender like a normal casino
4- Blackjack by a player pays 3:2 like in a normal casino
5- Doubling and re-splitting after splitting are restricted
6- Insurance bets are not allowed. (Dealer (house) showing an Ace and taking insurance bets)
